# depretensioner
Firefox browser extension that replaces occurances of the word 'whilst' with 'while', and 'amongst' with 'among', in webpages.

Since Firefox version 46, Mozilla fucked everyone over by forbidding unsigned or self-signed extensions (unless you use a development/nightly/unbranded build).

To get around this, every time you start your browser, direct it to about:debugging in the URL bar.  Click on "Load Temporary Add-on" then select any of the files in the depretensioner directory.
